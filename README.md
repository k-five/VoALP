## Vocabulary of Advanced Linux Programming   
### written by:  Mark Mitchell, Jeffrey Oldham and Alex Samuel   

Since I am learning English and meanwhile programming, after reading this book, collected those vocabularies that were difficult to me. Thus I found their definition(s) in: Oxford Advanced American Dictionary and put in a `.csv` file and also `.odt` and `.pdf` as well.

What I have done is this:  
 - the definition of the vocabulary itself  
 - whether it is noun. verb, adverb, adjective  
 - example for each part  
 - the '-- >` means this is a example from Oxford    
 - the `= >` means this is the example of the book  
 - add synonym if exist and antonym as well  
 - appendix C, D, E, and F was omitted

For intermediate English learners that are going to go one level upper :)

Good luck.
